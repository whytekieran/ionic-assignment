  The calorific app is designed as my project, it displays a selection of 
different foods and the average calory amounts. Displayed in a tab layout there
is also an about page which describes the app itself. ..The user can click on
each food and they will be shown a a list of ingredients to show the user what exactly goes into some of their favourite foods as well as a small dynamic selection with rodio buttons, allowing the user to choose how may calories for which amount of food. Multiple branches and commits to github were made on the project and the project is also availible on my github account. 

The project can be viewed on my github account at the following address:

-After completing this project i can say safely that i have covered all areas of the specification.

1) Comments have been made throughout the code that explains it and there is also a README.md file (this file) 

2)The code for my project can easily be run as part of an ionic project using ionic serve

3)The app is extremely usable and is very straight forward to interact with for a user

4)There are dynamic elements for the user to interact with

5)Ive shown that ive attempted to manage my source code using standard tools
There have also been multiple branches and commits to my github account with this project.

I have also used a little external CSS

Thanks for everything Ian and Eamon

Kind Regards
Ciaran Whyte
